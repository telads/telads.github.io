### Strategy is to scope out the structure of the skeleton and skin it

Strategy - A tool to calculate the number of days spent in the EU and Schengen area for the purpose of applying for a visa

Scope - Include some information, and guidance and add a calculation tool

Structure - One page which includes a calculator 

Skeleton - Header at the top, footer at the bottom, main content in the middle, no menu, no side bar

Skin - Colour, look, feel - must be accessibility compliant - light, simple and user-friendly
